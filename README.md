Material Resume
===============

My original plan was to create a website solely based around Google Material
design using images, fonts, and color from their Material Guide. I ended up
keeping the styling guides and making a website for my online resume as I 
felt that would have been a better allocation of my time. 

Finished Product
===============

The finished resume is quite simple and uses simple cards with red and blue-grey
coloring. Overall, it's a clean presentation of my resume.
