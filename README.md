Material Resume
===============

My original plan was to create a website solely based around Google Material
design using images, fonts, and color from their Material Guide. I ended up
keeping the a small portion of their style guide and making a web page for my online resume.

Finished Product
===============

The finished resume is simple and to the point. I focused on the typography and spacing more than any other 
design element. This is now my official online Resume.
